Make sure that you have the following folders set up prior to running the application
images: This is where authorised faces are going to be stored
unauthorised: This is where unauthorised users' faces are going to be captured and stored

To add user, simply head over to the tab with the same label and take your photo
The photo will then be saved in the images folder with the name that you provided

Once activated, the program will start capturing the faces of those not saved in the images folder and will save them
in the unauthorised folder as mentioned before
